This document describes several languages for the expression of
logical formulas, each containing the preceding.  For convenient
reference, the languages are given names chosen to suggest their
relative sizes:

- *XS* (extra-small), the first language, is for sentential logic.
- *S* (small) is for first-order logic without identity.
- *M* (medium) is for first-order logic with functions and identity.
  We believe but have not undertaken to prove that M is equivalent to
  the TPTP language of first-order formulas, FOF.
- *L* (large) adds some convenience features: typed quantification,
  unique existential quantification, and skolem functions.  It is at
  least roughly comparable to the TFF (typed first-order formulas)
  language of TPTP.
- *XL* (extra-large) adds sets and set operations.  /Open question:
  add tuples?/

One goal of the paper is to provide a more precise description of the
target language(s) for our work translating Alloy models into
first-order logic.

* Design goals
The primary goal is to provide a convenient syntax for presentation
and discussion of formulas that is as far as possible agnostic on the
particular symbols used for quantification and logical operators.
Textbooks on logic are notoriously divergent in their choices of
symbols, and so are those who publish papers containing logical
formulas.  Software for dealing with formulas is equally various in
its choices.  We see no reason to insist that logical conjunction be
expressed with "&" but not with "/\" or "âˆ§" or even just "and", and so
on.

* Language XS:  sentential logic
* Language S:  first-order logic
* Language M:  first-order logic with identity and functions
* Language L:  additional convenience features
* Language XS: first-order logic plus set theory
